Hi! Thank you for downloading our program.
If you're having this error on the installation (./install-requirements.sh: line 66: easy_install: command not found)
Just manually install it by typing "easy_install shodan" on your terminal. If you also find this problem (mailfy command not found)
Just install "osrframework". You also need a Shodan API key for some features we
have on the tool.

HOW TO EXECUTE COMMANDS?

For core_commands:            For sub_commands:

FORMAT:                       FORMAT:
run [core_commands]           [sub_command]

The only difference is that for core commands you add "run" but for
sub commands you don't add "run".

Thank your again for installing the tool have fun, HAPPY INVESTIGATING!
VERSION: 1.0
